It examines accounting from an external user's perspective: an external user being an investor or a creditor. Such users would need to understand financial accounting in order to make investing or lending decisions. However, to attain a good understanding, it is also necessary to be familiar with how the information is derived. Therefore, students would learn how to prepare the reports or statements resulting from financial accounting and how to use them for decision-making.", "Faculty": [{"label": "Business Analytics", "value": "140"}, {"label": "Science", "value": "10"}, {"label": "Statistics", "value": "20"}, {"label": "FASS", "value": "2"}, {"label": "Engineering", "value": "8"}, {"label": "Computing", "value": "20"}], "Industry": [{"label": "Finance", "value": "60"}, {"label": "Education", "value": "20"}, {"label": "Information & Communication", "value": "20"}, {"label": "Oil & Gas", "value": "10"}, {"label": "Construction", "value": "30"}, {"label": "Public Sector", "value": "60"}], "Lessons": [0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1], "Breakdown": [{"label":"Assignments", "value":"0"}, {"label":"Class Participation", "value":"20"}, {"label":"Project Work", "value":"0"}, {"label":"Exams", "value":"80"}], "Year": [{"label": "Year 1", "value": "140"}, {"label": "Year 2", "value": "40"}, {"label": "Year 3", "value": "10"}, {"label": "Year 4", "value": "10"}], "Fulfilled Requirements": [{"label": "Core", "value": "100"}, {"label": "Unrestricted Elective", "value": "100"}]}, "EC1301": {"Code": "EC1301", "Name": "Principles of Economics", "Description": "This course is designed to teach the basic principles of economics to undergraduates from non-economic majors.
