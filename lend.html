				<p><strong>May 30:&nbsp;</strong>Part 1:&nbsp;Lost&nbsp;days: Poverty, isolation drive chronic absenteeism in California’s rural&nbsp;school&nbsp;districts<br>
				<strong>May 31:&nbsp;</strong>Part 2: Lost days: Inside one rural California district’s effort to combat chronic absenteeism</p>

				<p>Kaylee’s circumstances caused her to&nbsp;routinely miss school days from the time she was in kindergarten through her high school years. The state now identifies students like her, who miss at least 10 percent of the school year, as “chronically absent.” It’s a problem that impacts school districts everywhere but is most acute in rural areas and small towns.</p>
				<p>When Kaylee, now 20, was in grade school, her mother’s pattern was to stay in a place until the eviction notice came, then run. Sometimes it would be to another part of Oroville, a rural town of about 15,000 people in Northern California’s Butte County where her family was from. Other times it would be out of state to small towns in Texas or West Virginia.</p>
				<p>Kaylee Adkins, who often had to stay home to care for her niece’s children, missed about a third of her senior year at Oroville’s Las Plumas High.</p>

				<p>Both of Kaylee’s parents died during her high school years and she ended up living with one of her older sisters, who had a teenage daughter about Kaylee’s age who had two young kids of her own. That made Kaylee a great aunt at the age of 16 and she was expected to stay home to take care of the children.</p>
				<p>Though they lived just a few blocks from Las Plumas High in the Oroville Union High School District, Kaylee missed all or part of 54 days — nearly a third of her senior year, her attendance records show.</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 4px">"Going to school was always dependent on what my family needed."</h3>
				<p style="font-size: 90%">View EdSource’s video story on how isolation and poverty drive high rates of chronic absenteeism in rural Butte County, California.</p>
				<p>“I was always like one step behind,” Kaylee said in a recent interview. “Going to school was always dependent on what my family needed.”</p>
				<p>She was among the 26 percent, or about 600 students, at Oroville Union High School District who were chronically absent during the 2017-18 school year, according to an EdSource analysis of California Department of Education data.</p>
				<p>Statewide, more than 700,000 students, or about 11 percent, were chronically absent. About 10 percent of the 1,000 districts statewide had rates near the level of Oroville Union High’s or significantly higher. Most of those districts were in rural areas, the analysis found:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Of the 98 districts with rates higher than 20 percent, 84 were in rural areas.</li>
				<li>Of the 27 districts with rates higher than 30 percent, 26 were in rural areas.</li>
				<li>Of the 40 counties where rates were above the statewide average,&nbsp;30 are rural as identified by Rural County Representatives of California, a statewide group.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Students who are regularly missing school can be found in cities, suburbs and small towns throughout California and the United States.</p>
				<p>Chronic absenteeism takes a toll on almost all aspects of student success and wellbeing, according to a <a href="https://awareness.attendanceworks.org/wp-content/uploads/Research2016.pdf" target="_blank">large body of research</a>. A student can fall significantly behind in their classwork after missing just a week.</p>
				<p>As more time is missed, the connections to school begin to fray. Students become more likely to use drugs and engage in other unhealthy behaviors, the research shows. And in the end, they are more likely to drop out.</p>
				<h3><strong>A call to action</strong></h3>
				<p>These realities have been present in California’s rural districts for decades, yet only recently became visible to educators, parents and youth advocates.</p>
				<a href="https://edsource.org/?p=613074">
					<img class="storyimg" src="https://mk0edsource0y23p672y.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/absenteeism-map_thumb.png"></a>
				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 4px">Mapping chronic absenteeism</h3>
				<p style="font-size: 90%">View EdSource’s interactive map of chronic absenteeism rates to see how they are concentrated in rural California.</p>
				<p>The state has long tracked schools’ truancy rates, but that only accounts for unexcused absences. It wasn’t until the 2016-17 school year that the state started reporting&nbsp;details on all absences –&nbsp; unexcused, excused and those due to suspension.</p>
				<p>The state used that information to generate a chronic absenteeism rate and included it on the <a href="https://www.caschooldashboard.org/" target="_blank">California School Dashboard</a>, the statewide report card for schools.&nbsp;On the state dashboard, schools with chronic absenteeism rates ranging from more than 10 percent to 20 percent are labeled as “high.” Rates above 20 percent are considered “very high.”</p>
				<p>But the state only <a href="https://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/" target="_blank">releases</a> the overall rate, not the breakdowns showing why students were absent. The Oroville Union High School District provided EdSource its records, which showed what’s behind the district’s 26 percent chronic absenteeism rate:<span style="color: #ff00ff">&nbsp;</span>64 percent of days missed by district students in 2017-18 were unexcused, while 29 percent were due to excused absences, like illness and out-school suspensions.&nbsp;The rest were days missed due to in-school suspensions and independent study.</p>
				<p>The state’s action to collect more information on why students were missing school came after more than a decade of advocacy on the issue, most notably by Hedy Chang and her San Francisco-based organization, Attendance Works. Chang sees absenteeism as a serious threat to student achievement in every school, but she worries particularly about how it has overwhelmed rural communities.<br>
