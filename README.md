### About
Financial Inclusion Hackathon Project (1st Place Winner)
StCred (StreetCredit). It is a platform that allows crowdfunded micro-loans for students. The platform targets students that need to take loans to survive until their next paycheck. By allowing investors to invest in a shared pool of money, and when students can only withdraw from that pool, it reduces the default risk of the loan as investors do not lend to individual students directly.

### Key Ideas

(1) An interactive financial literacy game (phone application) will be used to teach students about good practices such as saving and paying off debts.

(2) An interactive psychometric assessment (phone application) will be used as a proxy for the credit worthiness of the students.

(3) Machine learning algorithms will be used to automate the process of loans. Students who are deemed credit worthy can have their loan approved instantly, while a follow-up can be done with students who are flagged.

(4) For approved applicants, (using a phone application) cash can be disbursed and loans repaid easily at community shops or common stores (e.g Safeway)

 

### Thought Process

 We were trying to solve 4 important problems and we built our solution around these 4 problems.

(1) How do we get investors to crowdfund â€“ We need to provide reasonable interest rates, and at the same time lower the risk of defaulting of the loan.

(2) On the students side, we need to improve their financial literacy

(3) We also need to do some form of risk management by screening out applicants

(4) Lastly, we need an easy form of disbursement and repayment of funds.
